When reporting a bug, please include the following:

**PLATFORM:**
*e.g. "local tiles", "webtiles", or "console". Putting this in the labels is
also fine.*

**VERSION:**
*e.g. "0.18", ""0.19-a0-1891-ge1d1fe8". If you can launch the game, you can
find this information by pressing ?V; the version will be at the top of the
screen. If not, check the changelog in the 'docs' directory.*

**DESCRIPTION:**
*What happened? What went wrong? What else was going on at the time of the
problem? Can you reproduce the issue? If you have a save file or crash files,
please also include those; if you ask, we can help you find them.*

Please do not use this to request features, unless you are one of Crawl's
developers.

Thanks!
